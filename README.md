# push_swap
push_swap is a project aimed at implementing sorting algorithms in C language. In this project, the sorting algorithm Radix is taken as a basis, realized on stack operations, demonstrates the principles of efficient sorting algorithms as well as C programming skills, including working with data structures, code optimization, and problem-solving.
